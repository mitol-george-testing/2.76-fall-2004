description: Problem set 5 of the term project. Each problem set of the term project
  is 1-2 pages of design summary of your important decisions/modeling/progress to
  date. We would expect to see detailed sketches, major equations and plots which
  demonstrate that you are on the right track.  A short discussion of risks/mitigation
  plans and your group's schedule (constrained by the syllabus of course) would be
  important as well.
